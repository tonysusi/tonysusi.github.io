###The official unofficial England 2006 World Cup Song 
_London, UK_
**Web Designer/Developer**  
_Dec 2005 to June 2006_

_"I could write a world cup song"_ a friend boasted in the pub one night and within 10 minutes, four of us hatched a plan to release our World Cup anthem on the web.  

**My role was to:**  
- Code the site, which included audio and video streaming  
- Create and manage the database and develop a voting system   

Scoring over 800,000 hits in 52 countries within a month, we were perhaps a little too successful. Having used a reworking of the Dad's Army theme tune, the publishers wouldn't give us permission to release the song - but instead allowed Sony to do so!
